### Embracing Efficiency with Buildpacks 
As the demand for rapid application deployment surges, developers seek streamlined approaches to containerization. Enter Buildpacks, a game-changing technology revolutionizing the way we build and package applications. 

At its core, Buildpacks automate the containerization process, abstracting away complexities while ensuring consistent and secure deployments. By analyzing application source code, Buildpacks intelligently detect dependencies and configure runtime environments, eliminating manual intervention. 

Builders, the engine behind Buildpacks, leverage these capabilities to transform source code into OCI-compliant container images effortlessly. This approach not only accelerates development cycles but also enhances the reliability and reproducibility of deployments. 

### How Securepacks works?
Securepacks operates on your source code in two phases: detect and build.

#### ` Detect phase `
During the detect phase, the buildpack scans your source code for specific indicators to decide whether it should be included in the build process.

In the How to use section, you can observe that `initializ-buildpacks/npm-install` is utilized. This happens because the NPM Install Buildpack’s detection logic searches for a `package.json` file in the app’s source code. Since our sample app includes this file, the NPM Install Buildpack passes detection.

Each buildpack has unique detection criteria based on the dependencies it manages. Once a buildpack successfully passes detection, it specifies a contract outlining what it requires and what it will provide for the subsequent build phase.

#### ` Build phase `
During the build phase, the buildpack contributes to the final app image, fulfilling the contract established in the detect phase. These contributions may include adding an image layer with a dependency binary (such as the Node.js engine) or executing a command (such as `npm install`).

In the tutorial, the `pack build` output includes a section for the NPM Install Buildpack under the “BUILDING” header. This shows that the buildpack runs `npm install` to install the app’s dependencies. Following this, the NPM Start Buildpack sets the start command to `node server.js`.


### How do Securepacks relate to the Cloud Native Buildpacks project?
Securepacks implement the Buildpack API described in the [Cloud Native Buildpacks Specification](https://github.com/buildpacks/spec). The build and detect phases of Securepacks are designed to be run by the CNB lifecycle.
