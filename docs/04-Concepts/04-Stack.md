### Building on a Solid Foundation with Stacks 

In the dynamic landscape of containerization, Stacks emerge as the bedrock upon which applications are built and deployed, shaping their performance, security, and scalability. 

Stacks encompass runtime environments, comprising libraries, dependencies, and configurations tailored to the unique requirements of applications. By curating optimized Stacks, organizations can enhance resource utilization, streamline deployments, and mitigate compatibility issues. 

Moreover, Stacks play a pivotal role in ensuring adherence to industry standards and best practices. By aligning with frameworks like Security and Lifecycle Synchronization

Assurance (SLSA), Stacks bolster trust and compliance in containerized environments, fostering resilience and reliability. 

Furthermore, Stacks empower organizations to leverage Builders and Buildpacks effectively, facilitating the seamless transformation of source code into OCI-compliant container images. This streamlined approach accelerates development cycles, enhances reproducibility, and fosters innovation. 

In essence, Stacks represent the foundation of modern containerization, empowering organizations to architect resilient and scalable solutions that drive business growth and agility. 


### Fortifying Security with SLSA 

In an era plagued by cybersecurity threats, establishing trust in containerized environments is paramount. Enter Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA), a framework designed to fortify the security posture of container images throughout their lifecycle. 

SLSA mandates rigorous adherence to best practices, encompassing vulnerability scanning, cryptographic signing, and transparency in the software supply chain. By enforcing these standards, organizations mitigate the risk of supply chain attacks and ensure the integrity of their containerized workloads. 

Moreover, SLSA integrates seamlessly with tools like Grype and Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), enabling comprehensive vulnerability analysis and supply chain visibility. This holistic approach empowers organizations to make informed decisions regarding the security and provenance of container images. 

In essence, SLSA serves as a beacon of trust in the turbulent seas of containerization, fostering resilience and confidence in the face of evolving threats. 

### What stack contains?
A stack consists of two images:
 - `build image`: the environment in which your app is built
 - `run image`: the OS layer on which your app runs
